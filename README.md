# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-Analysis

### Problem Statement

As an analyst, you decide to address the problem Uber is facing - driver cancellation and non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue. 

##### Business Objectives

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

1. Request id: A unique identifier of the request
2. Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
3. Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
4. Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
5. Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
6. Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available

Note: Only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.

1. Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber. 
Hint: Create plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; identify the most problematic types of requests (city to airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots
2. Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
Find the time slots when the highest gap exists
Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots
3. What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).
4. Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
